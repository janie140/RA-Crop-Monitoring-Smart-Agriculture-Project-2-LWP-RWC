Phase 1: Using Hyperspectral Sensor and Machine Learning to Predict Water Potentials of Wild Blueberries during Drought Treatment

Detecting water stress on crops early and accurately minimizes its impact. This study aims to measure water stress in wild blueberry crops non-destructively by analyzing proximal hyperspectral data. The data collection took place in the summer growing season of 2022. A drought experiment was conducted on wild blueberries in the randomized block design in the greenhouse, incorporating various genotypes and irrigation treatments. Hyperspectral data (spectral range: 400-2515 nm) using a handheld spectroradiometer and leaf water potential data using a pressure chamber were collected from wild blueberry plants.
